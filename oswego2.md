## Oswego

Oswego is a SUNY school located in upstate New York. According to Bootie, Oswego college was a complete waste of his time, because of the lack of dedication he saw in his fellow students, so he attended one semester at Oswego and then dropped out his second semester. In 2000, the year Bootie would have attended, Oswego had an average of 1,500 freshman students, a ACT requirement of 22-26, and the acceptance rate was 51%. What these statistics allow us to believe is that Oswego was a easy school to attend, and in Bootie’s opinion, it shows through the weak work ethic of the students. Because of Bootie’s experience at Oswego, his opinion on the college experience changed drastically, from wanting to attend Harvard to describing the college experience as the, “The Land of Lies in which most people were content to live-- in which you paid money to an institution and went out to get drunk instead of reading books… and then, at the end of the day, presumable simply on the account of the financial transaction between you and the school, you declare yourself educated” (Page 61). This quote grants the reader a clear picture of the person Bootie has become, an arrogant, selfish kid who believes he is above a college education. This development in Bootie’s character will become a crucial role in the story of The Emperor’s Children, as it will lead him to seek out his long lost uncle, but first Bootie heads back to Watertown, to live with his mother once again.
