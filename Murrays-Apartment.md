## Murrays-Apartment

Bootie at last makes the journey to live with his uncle in his Upper West side apartment. The book does not say the loction of Murray’s Apartment, but we do know that Murray’s Apartment overlooks Central Park. In 2001, the Upper West Side was facing strong opposition from tight-knit African American Communities that lived near the Upper West Side before being exposed to Gentrification. When Bootie begins living with Murray, his idol, he becomes obsessed with impressing and aiding his uncle. He says this about his uncle, “He was what he would call a stand-up guy. For some reason, that was the phrase that stuck in Bootie’s head, for Murray, like homer’s rosy-fingered dawn, just the phrase that seemed to sum him up” (Page 202). When his uncle's family supports him it allows for Bootie to live a care free life in the Upper West Side under the aid of his most esteemed mentor, representing the highest point in Bootie’s life.
