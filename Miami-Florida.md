## Miami-Florida

In 2001, Miami Florida was struggling through immigration issues and protests, but it was also a prime vacation spot. To Bootie, Miami, Florida represents new beginnings. Bootie is figuratively taking a “vacation” from his old life and forming a new identity which will allow him to rediscover himself as a writer, free from the restraints of his family and New York.

Bootie says this about his move to Miami and change in identity “This truly felt like a new beginning. A baptism.
